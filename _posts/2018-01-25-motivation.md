> `Wings of Fire`

This was the book which I had read when I was in engineering college-ZHCET, AMU, Aligarh . This was the book which has inspired me a lot .As per Kalam sahab, to be successful 4 things are needed-

* a.Dream.                                         
* b.Confidence to achieve that dream.
* c.Perseverance and optimistic attitude
* d. Continuous hard work

I hope, Dr. APJ Abdul Kalamâ€™s biography in this video,  definitely motivate you to achieve your aim:
