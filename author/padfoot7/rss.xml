	     <h4 id="why-we-should-go-for-civil-services">Why we should go for Civil Services?</h4>

<p>Please consider these images. We have seen in real or pictures countryside ravaged by floods year after year with no respite in sight. We encounter overcrowded and dirty railway station while waiting for the train from yesterday. We have never had a pleasant experience with a government organization for pettiest of the works. We have a problem with non-existent roads, drains, sanitation facilities, ill functioning government schools and overcharging private schools. We see emancipated rickshawallahs and laborers coming all the way from the poorest districts living precarious lives. We encounter poverty, squalor and disease at every corner in our villages, towns and cities unless we prefer to keep our eyes closed.</p>

<p>The question arises what we do in these situation. The common approach would be to thank our lucky stars that we have the opportunity to escape all of this. We have a professional degree which will guarantee a well paid job on or off the campus. We will have the opportunity to earn decent amount of legal money through which we can make our life better as well as of our families. There is nothing wrong with this individualistic approach per se. In any case whatever we do, be it the top most corporate honchos or be it our rerhiwalahs, we are actually helping to build this country. Every one of us, if we are doing honest work in our chosen field we are serving India directly or indirectly.</p>

<p>Now, what is the way to directly contribute to solve the problems we see around us each and every day. One of the surest way to go about it, is the elite Indian Civil Services. There are other options also like civil society organization and of course politics. But, if we analyze the careers of activists and politicians, one thing surely comes out. There is no single exam for these careers, which one can pass and be part of their ilk. Civil Services exam conducted by UPSC every year for 24 services gives us the opportunity to be part of the Indian governance system by passing an examination. And as it has a syllabus, it can be prepared for.</p>

<p>Lets try and understand what exactly a career in civil services offers you beside the popular Lal Batti and a big house in the center of the town. There are 24 different services in this particular exam , the most popular being IAS, IPS, IFS and IRS. There are others like IRTS, IRPS, IDAS, ICLS, IIS, RPF. At the initial stage itself you can see the multiplicity of choice. If we talk only about IAS, the diversity of the roles is mind boggling. In the initial 10-15 years of one’s career, this person is responsible for nearly everything in his district. He is effectively accountable for all the governmental programs in the district. This exposure at such an early stage is incomparable to any private job. In the later stages, he has the opportunity to work at Policy formulation level and here also the range of the available fields is huge. From railways to finance, aviation to manufacturing, it is the officers of these exalted services which are still the steel frame of Indian administration. In addition to the diverse opportunities, these services also offer you the respect, recognition and prestige. The security of the job in All India and Central services is also constitutionally protected.</p>

<p>So far so good. Civil Services is prestigious and important. But, what about our engineering/professional/not so professional degrees? Isn’t it for the people from the social science or humanities background? Lets talk about and other myths about this.</p>

<p>The most popular myth about this exam is that it is one of the most difficult exam if not the most difficult exam in the world. It is difficult, accepted yes but then CAT is not easy, neither was the entrance competitions you have already faced till now. It is interesting in the sense that you are competing against the bright students from every streams. You are fighting for a place with the people from the IITs, IIMs, AIIMS and the best colleges of India. This particular exam in that sense is mighty equalizer. Whatever some people might say the exam does not favor any particular stream or region or section. What it does require in liberal dosage is the patience and the commitment of honest hard work. The difficulty is not so much in the quality of the exam per se but the depth and width of coverage it requires.</p>

<p>The other important myth is about the exam being more suited for the students from social sciences background. Although, it helps to have prior understanding about the history, polity and economy of India , but there is nothing that cannot be acquired. In fact, if we analyze the available data , the fact comes out that there is fair representation of people from different backgrounds. If you have followed the news related to UPSC exam in the previous months, you might have come across to the demands from a certain section of students in fact the exam favors people from engineering background. The truth lies somewhere in between.</p>

<p>Now why should I as an engineer make this choice of civil services as career leaving behind my beloved engineering which I enjoy and which pays me well. This question is purely personal and it is related to a more basic one. What is your approach in choosing your career? Or is there any approach whatsoever. It could be like most of us: A series of continuing chance events or is there any method to the madness.</p>

<p>Everyone has to decide for himself where does his or her interest lie. I tell you about my situation. I choose engineering degree because I was good at Maths in my school and if you are from Bihar and are good at Maths you choose engineering! If you are not you choose Medicine. Effectively it turns out to be your basic graduation degree. In case you love engineering and would like to be working in the area of high end problem solving , great , you should continue with it. But, if you don’t particularly ‘love’ engineering and you want to do an MBA after engineering or you are joining a software firm to do an MBA afterwards, then you need to ask why you are doing it. Here I am not saying that people who are doing an MBA or working in software firms are doing anything wrong. What is important to understand that we need people who are interested in the things they are doing in every domain be It public or private.</p>

<p>Moreover, Its also important to understand that civil services are not merely any other career option. A representation in these services is a marker of the participation of the different groups of this diverse nation. We keep hearing that the representation of Muslims in civil services is stuck around 2-3 percent and it is true too. The experts have gone into the reasons for this and it has been shown the fault lies both ways. The Muslim community at times feels disadvantaged but it is important to analyze that are we giving proper importance to these services. Yes the final ratio of selected Muslim candidates is skewed but is it not skewed at the first stage of appearing in the prelims stage itself. The need of the hour is that the best and brightest of our students come forward and take up this challenge. More and more students , boys as well as girls need to seriously think these services as a career option. All of you in AMU are capable to qualify. The only needed thing is earnest effort.</p>

<h4 id="basic-education">Basic Education</h4>
<p>I belong to a very small village named Harraypur,District – Pilibhit ( UP ).My basic education up to 8th class was completed in government School i.e. Primary and Secondary schools of my village in Hindi Medium. From 6th Class I started learning English Alphabet. Later on I did my 9th and 10th from Gurunanak Higher Secondary School ,Bhaisah Dist-Pilibhit.After completing my 10th we shifted in Bareilly as my father got Group  job in Bareilly .Here I took admission in Manohar Bhushan Inter College and completed my 10+2 .Though I was in Hindi medium but I remained topper in almost all the classes.</p>

<p>How I improved myself from a Hindi medium background to English</p>

<p>I completed my B.Tech from Aligarh Muslim University in the year 2009.This was the place where I developed myself and prepared my personality for civil service and corporate world.</p>

<p>Firstly, for improving English we formed a forum called Illumini (a peer group of 10 friends) where we used to discuss various national and international issue. In this forum we used to conduct mock interviews, GDs, debate etc.This forum has prepared my personality for CSE and other exams.</p>

<p>I was also the part of a college forum called @INGENIOUSSOLUTIONS right from first year. In this I worked for 4 years continuously and learned many things including how to speak English. This was the forum where seniors advised juniors to improve their personality and prepare them for future job opportunities. This was extremely useful for my personality development.</p>

<p>I was also part of University Literary Club but here I was not in any leadership role but learned many things from students who used to come to participate in Essay writing,Debates,Extempore,Quizzing etc.</p>

<p>Other than that I improved myself by participating in various literary activities as well as in sports activities of college and various residential Halls.</p>

<p>Thus I used AMU’s resources in the best possible manner to improve myself. So the ground work for civil service was already done in AMU .</p>

<h4 id="preparation-of-upsc">Preparation of UPSC</h4>
<p>After working 14 months in Siemens and 1 year in Department of Atomic Energy I realized I need to start preparation as I wanted to contribute to the society in a better manner as well as I was not satisfied with my professional advancement .So I started preparation in the year 2012. I did not join any coaching. I was full time working during my preparation phase. In 2013, I have given my first serious attempt (though first attempt was in 2012 where I could not clear prelims)and alhamdolilah I was able to crack Prelims ,and mains though in interview I could not score well (121 out of 275).Because of interview I could not make it in the final list. But I again started my preparation with full energy and in 2014 exam I was able to crack this it with rank 625 (Allocated IPS). Moreover this time I scored 190 marks in interview. I have taken English medium for all the stages of exam although I was from pure Hindi medium background. It was possible because I worked really hard to improve myself during my 4 years stay in AMU.</p>

<h4 id="message-to-youth-and-civil-service-aspirants-">Message to Youth and Civil Service Aspirants-</h4>

<p>Dream as big as possible but always prepare yourself for Plan B. Even after plan B, Plan C must be there. As in my case if I could not get success in civil I was having my alternate career in Department of Atomic Energy.
Decide your destination as early as possible and start working towards it.
In my opinion Success=Summation of each day work carried out for years
As in my case I worked a lot in my college to improve my personality and learning English. So you ll have to introspect your weakness and ll have to work upon them for years. So divide your target in the years, months, weeks and days and move ahead a little everyday. Achieve something every day.</p>

<p>For achieving your goal you need not be very intelligent .You need not be the best among your peers but you need to have passion to achieve your goal. As I was from very normal schools but I was having passion to achieve my target and I worked hard for that.
There is no discrimination with Muslim Youth/or with anyone in civil services .If you are having knowledge and expertise, you can crack any exam.
Try to get best possible guidance from your seniors .It is always better to learn from the experience of others rather than wasting your own time for years.
Never get demoralize from failures .Civil service exam is the test for patience and self confidence. So fail but fail better everytime. In.In the end you’ll get success.</p>

<h4 id="prelims-strategy-">Prelims strategy-</h4>

<p>It is one of the trickiest part of whole exam where one has to work really hard. Now only General Studies paper-1 counts in final ranking thus even one mark is very important. For general strategies my strategy was as follows–</p>

<ul>
  <li>Indian Polity-Laxmikanth (2-3 time reading)</li>
  <li>Modern History-Spectrum+NCERT(Bipin Chandra)</li>

<h4 id="gs-strategy">GS strategy</h4>

<p>GS is my one of the strongest area as I am reading newspaper right from 5th class(Hindi paper in those days). I used to listen news and TV debates. Thus I was already having opinion on various issues and during preparation phase I followed newspaper (Hindu),All India Radio,Rajya Sabha TV and Internet extensively.</p>

</ul>

<h4 id="interview">Interview</h4>
<p>The most important part of this exam is personality test. You can’t make personality overnight .So you have to work throughout your life to prepare for this. Thus one has to work on his personality while in school or college.As I have involved in number of activities during my college days in Aligarh Muslim University so I was at ease in this part.</p>

<p>This was the book which I had read when I was in engineering college-ZHCET, AMU, Aligarh . This was the book which has inspired me a lot .As per Kalam sahab, to be successful 4 things are needed-</p>

<ul>
  <li>a.Dream.</li>
  <li>b.Confidence to achieve that dream.</li>
  <li>c.Perseverance and optimistic attitude</li>

<p><img src="https://amu2ias.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/msa.jpg?w=300&amp;h=200" alt="Image" /></p>

<h4 id="background">Background</h4>

<p>I joined AMU for pursuing Computer Science Engineering.</p>

<p>After passing my Engineering in 2010, I joined STMicroelectronics and have been working there since then.</p>

<h4 id="preparation-of-cse">Preparation of CSE</h4>

<p>I have given three attempts. The 2012 attempt was more like testing the waters without much preparation. 2013 attempt was serious but I couldn’t clear the prelims. In 2014, I cleared the exam with 211 Rank.</p>

<p>I was motivated towards CSE as it provides ample opportunities to impact the life of so many people in a meaningful way which is difficult in most other jobs.</p>

<h4 id="message-to-youth-and-civil-service-aspirants">Message to Youth and Civil Service Aspirants</h4>

<p>I believe that first a person should analyze one’s skills one is good at and try to go for those fields which require those particular skills.</p>

<h4 id="prelims-strategy">Prelims strategy</h4>

<p>In the ever changing scenario of CSE, One thing is sure that General Studies will always play a major role in the CSE. In 2014, the Paper 2 (Aptitude paper) has been made qualifying which means that only Paper 1 (General Studies paper) will be counted for rankings. However, people should always try to improve their comprehension skills in English as writing skills are important for mains point of view and there maybe changes which can bring the Paper 2 back for rank calculations.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Indian Polity- Laxmikanth</li>
  <li>Modern History- NCERT(Bipin Chandra) + India’s Struggle for Freedom (Bipin Chandra)</li>
  <li>Ancient history and culture – I skipped most of the culture but I think NCERT + NIOS are good enough. Culture videos of unacademy on Youtube by Roman Saini are a good source for classical dances.</li>
  <li>Geography-G C Leong + Major topics from Physical geography notes of any coaching institute + Map practice of Rivers, Mountains, Sanctuaries</li>
  <li>Economy – Mrunal videos, PPTs and Economic Survey overview w.r.t. facts</li>
  <li>Environment – Shankar IAS Environment book + Independent Googling</li>
  <li>Science and Technology – From newspapers + BBC World Tech news</li>
  <li>Current Affairs -The Indian Express/The Hindu + Chronicle Magazine + Independent Googling + BBC World News</li>
  <li>After covering these resources, one maybe able to do only 30-40% of questions in pre with 100% surety which may not be sufficient to clear the exam. For a higher score, one has to take risks, especially when one is confused between just two choices. This is the change in my strategy for prelims between 2013 and 2014 attempts and it Clicked !!!.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="mains-exam">Mains Exam</h4>

<p>Optional Strategy (Geography)</p>

<p>For Geography, I relied on standard text books mentioned below alongwith coaching notes of Vajiram and Nitu Singh.</p>

<h5 id="paper-1-106-marks">Paper 1 (106 marks)</h5>

<ul>
  <li>Savindra Singh for Physical Geography + Nitu Singh notes</li>
  <li>Majid Hussain For Human Geography + Vajiram notes</li>
  <li>Shankar IAS Environment book for Environment + Newspapers</li>
  <li>Settlement Geography from Majid Hussain + Vajiram notes</li>
  <li>Perspective in Human Geography from Vajiram notes</li>
  <li>Models, laws etc from Vajiram notes
    <h5 id="paper-2-146-marks">Paper 2 (146 marks)</h5>
  </li>
  <li>Physical India from Khullar and Nitu Singh notes</li>
  <li>Maps from Nitu Singh maps compendium + independent Googling of the recent locations</li>
  <li>Current Issues from Mrunal, The Indian Express/The Hindu
    <h5 id="test-series">Test Series</h5>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I didn’t attend any test series. In my view, those who feel that they are not comfortable with expressing their views easily, they can join test series for mains. Else mere practicing the tests available in market is also good enough.</p>

<h4 id="gs-strategy">GS strategy</h4>

<p>Long term reading these days is the single most important way of achieving good results in GS papers. One should read widely from various sources like newspapers (The hindu, The Indian Express), magazines (Chronicle) and non-fiction books covering different aspects of social issues.</p>

<h4 id="essay-148-marks">Essay (148 marks)</h4>

<p>Got my highest marks among written papers in Essay. Frankly speaking, I never practiced writing a single essay. Again, those who have difficulty in expressing their views should practice. To right a good essay, my strategy was to write on a topic which is scientific/objective in nature and then cover as many dimensions of the topic as possible. Also, try to relate the topic with current happenings of the country and the world. During the exam, I used mind map technique to generate as many ideas about the topic as possible.</p>

<p>This time, there were two essays asked. I wrote on “Increasing competition faced by youth” and “Tourism ”.</p>

<h4 id="interview-168-marks">Interview (168 marks)</h4>

<p>Interview in my view is usually a reflection of oneself. To perform well, one should know about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Oneself – Place to where one belongs, Family Background, school, college, job, current place of stay etc</li>
  <li>Subject studied in College</li>
  <li>Subject taken as optional</li>
  <li>One’s own job if working or ever worked</li>
  <li>Current Affairs specially in the fields of economy, international relations, current social happenings, recent laws etc</li>
  <li>Hobbies – Mine was playing football</li>
</ul>

<p>Dear All,</p>

<p>I am FARHA HUSSAIN. I belong to Jhunjhunu district of Rajasthan and I cleared UPSC Civil Services Examination this year with a rank of 267. I want to share my story with you all and try and contribute towards motivating young students and aspirants. I cannot make any tall claims like a lot of successful aspirants of having suffered hardships or any lack of facilities. I have led a fairly comfortable life and have extremely understanding parents. There are dozens of civil servants in my family, thus the atmosphere to excel and do something in the public life was always there without anyone reinforcing it or talking about it at all. These things work as a great motivation, however, it also brings in a lot of expectations from you and then starts the struggle to try and match upto them. When you have everyone’s eyes set on you to see where you end up, it really weighs you down. Also, for girls there is a lot that the society expects from her.. to get married early, to settle as a happy housewife. If a woman thinks about herself first, she is thought to be selfish. I feel we must always be respectful to others’ wishes and thoughts but please do not let it stop you from achieving something that is dear to you. Listen to everyone, but follow your heart!</p>

<p>Despite coming from such a family, I too have faced a lot of these things and at times it took a toll on me. But in times of distress, I never stopped believing in my capabilities and I was certain I would make a mark surely. And my efforts paid when I became the second muslim girl from Rajasthan to clear the UPSC Civil Service Examination. This exam is definitely a test of intelligence, but it also tests your mental strength, patience and the like. It does not require you to be a master in each field of study, you are only expected to do a generalized study which I feel translates to studying SMART, rather than studying like a maniac cutting yourself from the world. I think studying 5-6 hours a day is enough provided you are consistent throughout the year. It tests your knowledge about the things happening in the world, around you etc.</p>

<p>I recommend the following combined strategy for Prelims and Mains as I never studied separately for them:</p>
<h4 id="books-for-general-studies">BOOKS for GENERAL STUDIES:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>NCERTS – class 6 to 12th if you have times. Otherwise do atlas class 11 and 12th NCERTs.</li>
  <li>Polity by Lakshmikanth</li>
  <li>Environment by ShankarIAS</li>
  <li>Geography – NCERTs, GC Leong, Wizard Publication</li>
  <li>Culture – Nitin Singhania</li>
  <li>CSAT Guide by Arihant</li>
  <li>History – Tamil Nadu Board Textbook for class 11,12 and Rajiv Ahir’s Modern History; Modern history by Bipin Chandra</li>
  <li>India After Independence by Bipin Chandra</li>
  <li>Economy by Ramesh Singh</li>
  <li>Economic Survey</li>
  <li>India Year Book</li>
  <li>Yojana Magazine</li>
  <li>Newspaper : Indian Express</li>
  <li>Current Affair Notes by Vision IAS Institute</li>
  <li>Reports of Finance Commission, Centre State relations etc.</li>
  <li>Latest Bills, Acts from presidia website</li>
  <li>Websites : Mrunal.org, insightsonindia.com, iasbaba.com</li>
  <li>For LAW Optional:</li>
  <li>Torts – Bangia</li>
  <li>IPC – R&amp;D</li>
  <li>Constitution – V N shukla</li>
  <li>International Law – S K Kapoor</li>
  <li>Contract – Jhabvala
For other topics I downloaded Bare Acts from internet and made notes from various articles on the internet. For recent case laws please buy Delhi University compendiums.
Articles from legalserviceindia.com, lawandotherthings blog website</li>
</ul>

<p>Follow latest cases from newspapers, internet and Quote them in your answers! Always write in points, quote section numbers if possible, write case laws. If you don’t remember the name of the case, write the facts at least! I remember reading a blog by one of the toppers and he had said when he could not recall any case laws he wrote about a Madhuri Dixit movie and how there was a controversy regarding copyright infringement relating to it.
When you can’t recall any case laws, say in a question about defamation, you can at least explain defamation by quoting the recent news about Kejriwal and cases filed against him regarding an issue. It would give the impression that you are well aware of the things around you and understand them well.
I strongly feel that most questions are current affairs based, so they are the most important portion of the syllabus. Do not ignore Newspaper reading at any cost. I helps you even in improving English Language which is a must. For ANSWER WRITING, please try and write in points, draw many diagrams, mind maps, quote from reports, data and recent schemes of government. Always write recent happenings in each paper, even in optional.
Never write extremely negative answers. Please write answers like a government servant, as if you are already an IAS officer. Do not criticise the government at every step. Always conclude your answer with a suggestion to improve things and on a positive note. Also, write one answer everyday. It will help you immensely.
Please remember, When you decide to take another step when you don’t think you can, that is what makes all the difference in your life! Go ahead, dream big, aspire high… Good luck to you.. Hope to meet you soon as an esteemed colleague very soon!</p>
